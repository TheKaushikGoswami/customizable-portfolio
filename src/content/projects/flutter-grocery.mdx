## Flutter E-Commerce Application for Grocery

This is a mobile e-commerce application for grocery ordering, developed from July to August 2025.

The app's core logic allows users to place orders, which are then routed to the nearest outlet for fulfillment and delivery. My main responsibilities included mobile app development, backend integration, and implementing the order processing logic.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Product Listings:** Products and store inventories are fetched dynamically.
- **Live Cart Updates:** The shopping cart updates in real-time as users add or remove items.
- **Real-time Store Selection:** The app automatically selects the nearest store based on the user's location to ensure seamless shopping and fast delivery.
- **Backend & Database:** Used Supabase and a custom Node.js/Express backend to manage data, users, and orders with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Payment Integration:** Implemented a payment gateway to handle in-app transactions.
