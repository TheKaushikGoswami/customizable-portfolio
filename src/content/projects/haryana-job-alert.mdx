## Haryana Job Alert

This is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to provide job alerts, news, and educational content to users. The platform is an ongoing project.

It consists of three main parts:
1.  **Public-facing Site:** Where users can consume content like job alerts and news.
2.  **Admin Panel:** A secure, comprehensive dashboard for content management.
3.  **User Application:** A user-focused app for accessing online courses and taking mock test series.

### Key Features & Responsibilities

- **Full-Stack Development:** Responsible for the entire stack, from database to UI.
- **Secure REST API:** Built a secure API using NestJS to handle all data communication.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implemented a robust RBAC system to differentiate permissions between admin and student users, secured with JWT for authentication and authorization.
- **Database Architecture:** Designed the database schema using Prisma with PostgreSQL.
- **Interactive UIs:** Built both the admin-facing dashboard and the user-facing application using Next.js.
- **Payments:** Integrated Razorpay to handle payments for courses and test series.
